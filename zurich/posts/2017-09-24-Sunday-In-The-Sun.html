        <p>This day was almost entirely dedicated to sitting on the roof in the sun and reading, per Abhi’s medical advice. I read a book on North Korea, a series of anecdotes gleaned from defectors from that country. A really crazy perspective-resetter involving very effective, unchallenged propaganda, failing Communism and epic famine, and a few ordinary people living insane lives. I highly recommend it! <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912?_encoding=UTF8&amp;keywords=north%20korea%20ordinary%20people%20book&amp;qid=1506443411&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">Nothing to Envy</a></p>
<p>I went to the HB with Abhi to get food. That place is like a mall! We got food at Migros (I got some honey, cheese and a half chicken, nom, plus a loaf of amazing garlic bread). Then Abhi had to do some clothes shopping so I walked with him. That was frustrating, since everything was so expensive; just looking at it was painful.</p>
<p>The half chicken was amazing, chowed on that then went back up to the roof. And when I came back down, the Romanian Google interns invited me and Betty up to the roof again for farewell tea–they were leaving the next morning. That was really fun. I ended up sitting up listening to music with them for a bit. When I woke up the next morning I found that Teo had left me a box of tea (for bringing her tea once) and they’d left me a cute little note. I resolved to visit Romania at some point.</p>
