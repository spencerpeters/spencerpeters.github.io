Most of the day was pretty boring! Slept in, went to the HB for groceries. Read more about Haskell--starting to grok it now :D

## Fast Forward to Frisbee

Walk with Abhi a good distance to a park on the Limmat and play some frisbee!

He tells me about the struggle of education in India and why he's stressed out right now--he's worked so long for this opportunity and he's only got 4 months (2 gone already) to convince his prof to extend his stay at the ETH. We play a lot of fun frisbee at the park and meet a cool dude named Michael.

## Dinner

Alice put together a 2+ floor dinner (for the upper level of the floor 2 splitlevel.) Astonishingly, all 9 of us were there. I made garlic bread and some salad with cucumbers and tomatoes. It was great. Met a couple of new arrivals; a rowdy socialitealita named Camilla from Italy, and a subdued electrical-engineer-turned-machine-learner named Eric from Joisey (USA).

After the dinner, got in some good games of fussball and hit the hay.
