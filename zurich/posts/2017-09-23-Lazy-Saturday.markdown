Decided to sleep in after the previous night's adventure, which meant I had to meet Juyoung et al. in Brunnen rather than taking the train with them. I make myself a good breakfast, sit and read, am chilling and having a great time. Am about to go to Brunnen when I decide it would be a good idea to give Juyoung a ring first to make sure I can reach her (I don't know her friends).

I give her a call and am answered in rapid Swiss German--it doesn't take me long to realize that Juyoung has left her phone in the care of some station attendant! So much for Brunnen :P

I instead take an absolutely beautiful walk through the neighborhoods on my side of the river. I don't know why I have these pics, they're not representative of how lovely the walk was:

 I end up at the top of the hill:

I enter an innocuous-looking, Google-Maps legit path:

Which quickly turns into barely passable jungle! I haul alongside a small stream, dodging logs and swamps and brushing aside branches, for the better part of an hour.

Finally I make it out:

And on my way down am rewarded by seeing this fellow in some sort of big farm/ranch thingy:

Make it back to Culmann by tram and make myself pasta. This is the *first time* I've made myself pasta, and it hasn't been my friends boiling it for me, isn't that weird! I get it done and slather it with canned Bolognese and parmesan. It's decent :)

After that, the rest of the day isn't very exciting, until:

## Swing Dancing!

I read about an upcoming swing dance a while ago, and now, finally, I'm going! Finally find the place, a dance club hidden in a business park. The club is small and beautifully furnished and very lively. It's DJ'd but I really liked the music! Sit and watch for a bit--actually, many of the dancers there are quite good!

It takes me a little while to warm up get some good dances in, some with experienced folks where I get into the groove, and a few with beginners--after what I suppose was a fairly exhaustive footwork tutorial, a new girl approaches me again "to work on the foot stuff".

Soon I begin to worry about coughing on fellow dancers, since I'm still a bit sick, and at that point I decide to bail. Head home and crash!
