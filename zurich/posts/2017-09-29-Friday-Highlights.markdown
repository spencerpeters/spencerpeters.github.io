title: Tandemsprache, or, All Dark on the Friday Night Front

Not much happens in the morning! I go to ML exercise section, which is boring, but read ahead on slides. Meet a cool dude, a physicist and nanoengineer by training, swap stories about his work and Cobden's lab, talk a bit about math.

## Tandem (no, it's not yoga)

Meet up with my assigned tandem-partner, one Muriel, from the Sprachenzentrum to practice German. She's studying English and trying to improve her spoken English, which is already pretty solid! We decide to make it an English day so we can get to know each other a bit before I can barely communicate--next week will be a German day.

We hang out in a park, walk through the Aldstadt, check out a baby posh IKEA by the Hauptbahnhof, get an iced tea on the banks of the Limmat :D Good times!

After that I head back to Culmann. Eat some dinner, do some work, and then play Bang! with housemates. Bang! has no strategy but is a fun kind of Wild West roleplay.
