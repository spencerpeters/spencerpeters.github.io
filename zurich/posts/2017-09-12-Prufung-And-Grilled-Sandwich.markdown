Woke up bright and early, decided to sleep until a bit less early, then hastily showered and chowed down on some Butterbrot with Nutella. Off to class with Juyoung and Gideon.

Class was review and practice mostly. We learned a lot of words around das Essen (food), learned (finally) about how to signal the accusative case. Also read and listened to some confusing texts, which is always fun.

During my morning break I took a fun random walk:

I was nearly late getting back to class but I made it! :D

Lunch break Alex led us to a different cafeteria. The food was quite tasty but there were fewer reasonably priced options and we had to pay for bread (an outrage!)

Then we had an exam in class, a short written exam where we had to write an email to someone we wanted to sublet with. I kinda went overboard trying to express myself, at the least had fun!

Back at Culmann I hung out reading for a bit, then headed into town to get a power strip and transformer. Couldn't find a transformer, but I found a power strip and a neat military surplus store that sold boots at decent prices, plus some lovely flags--I might be back to decorate my room with them.

Back at Culmann again, I made myself a grilled sandwich, with pancetta and mushrooms and lots of Emmenthaler. It was very good! Finished it off with a fig and half a beer and some more bread and Nutella. Read more of *Cryptonomicon*, which is getting really good.

Did a little bit of German, read some more Haskell stuff. Talked to Yaoming, a stats Master's student, about the difference between R and Python and mooched a bit of cantaloupe, then hit the hay.
