title: Butterweggli Break

This being highlight mode, other than the titular break where I go to coop, buy a butterweggli and soak it in Nutella while reading Quantum Information notes, the only interesting thing that happens today is that Simon and I go on a bike ride! We coast through the woods above HÃ¶ngg and end up at the river, where we go swimming (briefly, it's freezing) and meet Oliver, who runs back with us as we bike (he's a marathon boss).

Other than that, it's all working on ML.
