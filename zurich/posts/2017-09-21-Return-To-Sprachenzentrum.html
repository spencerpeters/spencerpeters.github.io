        <p>Sleep through my first lecture ;) since I’m feeling under the weather. Refreshed, have a good conversation with Betty about the math problem I heard in the Mittagsseminar, eat a delicious bowl of muesli with yogurt and peaches, and read Ribbonfarm–chillin’.</p>
<p>Off to the Mittagsseminar, which is cool–learn about hypergraphs, where edges may attach to more than 2 vertices.</p>
<p>Run home and make myself a hasty tuna sandwich, then run to catch the bus to Hongger for another Quantum Information lecture. This one reviews probability axioms and is not so exciting, but that’s ok. The exercises afterward are really cool, the TA knows what he’s doing and dives right into some quantum in response to a question, which causes my jaw to drop wide open. Soon he’s talking about how, in general relativity, massive bodies’ warping of space creates causal structure; but these bodies being in superposition wrt their positional degrees of freedom creates a superposition of causal structures; the ramifications of this haven’t been worked out yet.</p>
<p>Meet an Iranian dude whose name I can’t spell, then catch the bus back to the Zentrum.</p>
<h2 id="deutchkurz-a1.2">Deutchkurz A1.2!</h2>
<p>Back to the Sprachenzentrum–wow, it’s beautiful–to study under Melanie again! First class is mostly logistics.</p>

<p>Then I go to a health insurance event, in which the administrators display incredible organization–their advice is complete to the T. After that I’m off to the student bar with Daniel et al. which is a good time. Aleks tags along and the two of us get food at the mensa.</p>
<p>Return to Culmann for some conversation–the place is a riot, with some people pregaming a clubbing session, others cooking dinner. Abhi bids me take a seat and I chat with him at Juyoung. Then play lots of fussball. Then I sit down and crank out a lot of log! It’s LOG, it’s LOG, it’s big and long and full of words! After the epic logging session I crash hard in preparation for an 8:00 tomorrow.</p>
