        <p>Woke up bright and early, decided to sleep until a bit less early, then hastily showered and chowed down on some Butterbrot with Nutella. Off to class with Juyoung and Gideon.</p>
<p>Class was review and practice mostly. We learned a lot of words around das Essen (food), learned (finally) about how to signal the accusative case. Also read and listened to some confusing texts, which is always fun.</p>
<p>During my morning break I took a fun random walk:</p>
<p><img src="../images/randomwalk1.jpg" alt="randomwalk1" /><br />
<img src="../images/randomwalk2.jpg" alt="randomwalk2" /><br />
<img src="../images/randomwalk3.jpg" alt="randomwalk3" /></p>
<p>I was nearly late getting back to class but I made it! :D</p>
<p>Lunch break Alex led us to a different cafeteria. The food was quite tasty but there were fewer reasonably priced options and we had to pay for bread (an outrage!)</p>
<p>Then we had an exam in class, a short written exam where we had to write an email to someone we wanted to sublet with. I kinda went overboard trying to express myself, at the least had fun!</p>
<p>Back at Culmann I hung out reading for a bit, then headed into town to get a power strip and transformer. Couldn’t find a transformer, but I found a power strip and a neat military surplus store that sold boots at decent prices, plus some lovely flags–I might be back to decorate my room with them.</p>
<p>Back at Culmann again, I made myself a grilled sandwich, with pancetta and mushrooms and lots of Emmenthaler. It was very good! Finished it off with a fig and half a beer and some more bread and Nutella. Read more of <em>Cryptonomicon</em>, which is getting really good.</p>
<p>Did a little bit of German, read some more Haskell stuff. Talked to Yaoming, a stats Master’s student, about the difference between R and Python and mooched a bit of cantaloupe, then hit the hay.</p>
