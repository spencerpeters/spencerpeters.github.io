## Go look at the pics!!

I'm relying on the pictures in the
[image gallery](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Lq7ncLU6Wt2UCwO02) to tell my story! I'll give a quick summary though!

## Friiiiday

Friday was a scavenger hunt! Got together with the usual lunch crew from my language class and we trekked across the city questing for answers: What were the colors of the five stained glass windows at the Fraumunster abbey? What was the form of the hole in the famous, nonexistent cube sculpture:

Pretty entertaining! After the hunt we left immediately (me, Daniel, Cody and Suraj) from the Zurich HB; we took the train to Gossau and then to Wasserauen. It was a good time:

Open container laws are not a thing here! We passed through some beautiful country:

We arrived at Wasserauen and hiked up some very steep trails/roads to the Berggasthaus there:

Then a delicious meal!! The shpetzli was *really* good.

Crashed; the next morning at 8 had breakfast, then set out for the Saentis, a spire nearly a mile above us. Set out at an absolutely breakneck pace--poor Suraj couldn't keep up with us hiking-maniac CS folks.

The hike up was exhausting and beautiful. At a certain point, it stopped feeling like Galbraith in Bellingham, and started feeling windswept and cold and majestic.

Then it started raining. We got coffee at a berggasthaus, then set out for the most intense part of the hike. We were holding onto cables, staring out into oblivion in fog:

and then it started *really* raining, so we turned around. We looped down the mountain, picked up some of our stuff at the haus where we'd stayed, and hopped the train back to Zurich! This involved missing a train by 30 seconds fiddling with tickets, freezing our sodden butts off, and lots of bread and salami.

Back in Zurich, we all took warm showers. I went downstairs to read through some Haskell, ended up hanging out with a physics PhD whose name I forgot :)

## Paaaaasta! #Hitalia

Then Daniel and I went over to Cody's place, 30 minutes by transit, and made dinner. We heated Daniel's amazing sauce and I made garlic bread; we topped off the whole thing with beer and Swiss chocolate. Sehr sehr gut!

Daniel and I went back to Culmann; I went back to reading and then got into a conversation with the two Romanian girls Deo and Adina. Fun conversation; they had some really really miserable professors :P

After that it was very late and I did some laundry and wrote this log :) Gute nacht zuesammen!
