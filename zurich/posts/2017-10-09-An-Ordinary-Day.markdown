Not much happens today (I know, finally!)

I skip class in the morning because the lecture notes are great, read them, meet Muriel for lunch (my tandem partner for learning German) and walk around the city. I'm definitely improving! But when I asked her to switch to Swiss German I found it much much harder to understand. Definitely quite a challenge.

After that, I go home and make myself lunch, do a little work, go to the thesis lab and log into my machine and realize I can't install anything without administrator privileges and get the ball rolling on getting those.

Then I take an amazing run, have dinner, (roughly, probably some more stuff happened), goof off and play foosball for a bit, go back to the thesis lab and do a game theory problem set, and crash.
