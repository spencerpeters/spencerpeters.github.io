        <h2 id="go-look-at-the-pics">Go look at the pics!!</h2>
<p>I’m relying on the pictures in the <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/Lq7ncLU6Wt2UCwO02">image gallery</a> to tell my story! I’ll give a quick summary though!</p>
<h2 id="friiiiday">Friiiiday</h2>
<p>Friday was a scavenger hunt! Got together with the usual lunch crew from my language class and we trekked across the city questing for answers: What were the colors of the five stained glass windows at the Fraumunster abbey? What was the form of the hole in the famous, nonexistent cube sculpture:</p>

</figure>
<p>Pretty entertaining! After the hunt we left immediately (me, Daniel, Cody and Suraj) from the Zurich HB; we took the train to Gossau and then to Wasserauen. It was a good time:</p>

<p>Open container laws are not a thing here! We passed through some beautiful country:</p>
<p><img src="../images/the_grass_is_darn_green.jpg" /> <img src="../images/beautiful_country.jpg" /></p>
<p>We arrived at Wasserauen and hiked up some very steep trails/roads to the Berggasthaus there:</p>

<p>Then a delicious meal!! The shpetzli was <em>really</em> good.</p>

</figure>
<p>Crashed; the next morning at 8 had breakfast, then set out for the Saentis, a spire nearly a mile above us. Set out at an absolutely breakneck pace–poor Suraj couldn’t keep up with us hiking-maniac CS folks.</p>
<h2 id="hike">Hike</h2>

<p>The hike up was exhausting and beautiful. At a certain point, it stopped feeling like Galbraith in Bellingham, and started feeling windswept and cold and majestic.</p>
<p><img src="../images/henhouse.jpg" /> <img src="../images/crazy%20trail.jpg" /></p>
<p>Then it started raining. We got coffee at a berggasthaus, then set out for the most intense part of the hike. We were holding onto cables, staring out into oblivion in fog:</p>

<p>and then it started <em>really</em> raining, so we turned around. We looped down the mountain, picked up some of our stuff at the haus where we’d stayed, and hopped the train back to Zurich! This involved missing a train by 30 seconds fiddling with tickets, freezing our sodden butts off, and lots of bread and salami.</p>
<p>Back in Zurich, we all took warm showers. I went downstairs to read through some Haskell, ended up hanging out with a physics PhD whose name I forgot :)</p>
<h2 id="paaaaasta-hitalia">Paaaaasta! #Hitalia</h2>
<p>Then Daniel and I went over to Cody’s place, 30 minutes by transit, and made dinner. We heated Daniel’s amazing sauce and I made garlic bread; we topped off the whole thing with beer and Swiss chocolate. Sehr sehr gut!</p>
<p>Daniel and I went back to Culmann; I went back to reading and then got into a conversation with the two Romanian girls Deo and Adina. Fun conversation; they had some really really miserable professors :P</p>
<p>After that it was very late and I did some laundry and wrote this log :) Gute nacht zuesammen!</p>
