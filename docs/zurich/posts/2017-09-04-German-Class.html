<p>Tried to make myself some oatmeal; it actually tasted pretty good, and Juyoung gave me an egg to supplement it with. Took a quick shower and set out with Jenna, a cognitive science student from somewhere in the Midwest (Carleton) plus Juyoung and Suraj.</p>
<p>Jenna and I split off from Juyoung and Suraj and found our classroom. We grabbed a front-row table that quickly filled with a fine group of engaged students. We had a quick overview lesson where we learned phrases to use in class, like “Es tut mir leid, ich habe kein Achnung” (I’m sorry, I have no idea) Then we got a presentation from the UZSA, another shared organization between universities that manages sports and fitness. They really had their act together, made me excited to sign up for some lessons :D</p>
<p>After that we got a sweeping tour of the ETH/UZH shared campus in the ETH part of town (I think that’s how it works!) There was a really cool language center with lots of German DVDs and games, tons of pretty buildings, a nice gym which we didn’t really get to see, and best of all, meal halls with actually reasonable prices! In Seattle, students avoid on-campus dining halls, but here, they must greet them with open arms–the student prices are fully half to a third of off-campus dining. Which means I don’t have to cook every day, which is AWESOME!</p>
<p>Along the way, meet a cool Sri Lankan dude named Navi, a smooth social character who is also very friendly. Navi and I accumulate a small posse, including a Scotsman Sri Lankan named Prath, a Dutch girl named Christen, and a Korean girl named Do Yoon. After collecting our student cards and the first installment of our student stipend (I’m gonna pop some tags; 750 francs in my pocket :D ) we proceed to the Asia Mensa (or table, cafeteria) for lunch. The food is very tasty and filling. Navi and Christen set up a Facebook chat to meet for lunch again the next day.</p>
<p>From there it’s back to German! This part is fun, we get to learn smalltalk phrases and ask for each other’s names and countries and say, &gt; “How are you doing?!” &gt; “Just great, and you?!”</p>
<p>After that, I walk back to Culmannstrasse. Set plans to take a walk with Juyoung, but she is entangled with her luggage-recovering and reimbursing business, so, suitably chastened about trying to make plans, I hop on the cheap-groceries bandwagon with Suraj and Daniel from the UW. These yokels are trying to cook something. I lose myself in bewilderment at the store, with its crazy real time bread cooker:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>And its brands at every price point:</p>

<p>And eventually start overheating and overoptimizing, whereupon I tell Suraj and Daniel to walk home, execute a reboot, grab a few more things, pay for my food, and go home to cook. I make shakshuka, poached eggs in spicy tomato sauce, which is actually pretty good!</p>
<p>After that and after some goofy business about Abi having an identical twin, I head to the gym to check it out. Can’t find it and am actually mildly despairing when I happen upon a dark terrace with loads of partying students. Beneath this terrace is the gym, and inside the gym is a crazy Monday night gymnastics session! The entire 3-small-baskeball-court floor is occupied by intimidatingly fit partner yoga/slackliner/people wrapping themselves in fabric from the ceiling types. It’s pretty cool. I stand there gawking like a chicken’s head that’s just been cut off, then head to the elliptical for a brisk, sweat-soaking run. At this point, the gym closes; I adopt once more my chicken’s head pose as I search for the exit. I look so clueless, in fact, that I draw the attention of a card-man, who asks to see my student card. Fortunately, I remember from the presentation this morning the word for student card, and present him the card. I ask him if he speaks English, he says no, then proceeds to try to tell me that the gym is closed in English. I signal that I understand, then hack together a query: “Wo ist Ausgang?” He directs me down the stairs and I finally leave the gym!</p>
<p>Back at Culmann, I play a game of foosball, work on German flashcards, do laundry, write this log and crash! Cheerio!</p>
