    <section class="blogpostbody">
        <p>Squeezed into RIAI (Reliable and Interpretable AI) class for a confusing morning involving Counterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis. Had a Mittagsseminar on the completely esoteric and only-interesting-to-pure-math-yokels topic of pseudo-line arrangements having or not having bichromatic triangles, very bizarre. Then Randomized Algs.</p>
<p>After that, got a delicious pasta lunch at the Mensa, read a weird SSC-linked article about evolved religious defenses against alcoholism in Native American groups. And then I walked about 7 minutes to my doctor’s appointment :)</p>
<h2 id="doctors-visit">Doctor’s Visit</h2>
<p>I’d booked it the other night, really easily, just by sending emails to a couple of doctors on a big list. Finding the place was more difficult–the practice was hidden on the 3rd floor of an old building. But I made it in time and filled out a short form (if I had put a Swiss insurance they would have billed me directly, instead they’re sending the bill to Culmann so that I can give it to my UW insurance). I was really surprised how low-hassle it was.</p>
<p>Got my blood drawn, waited for a while reading a really cool SSC article about <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/09/05/book-review-surfing-uncertainty/">predictive processing</a>.</p>
<p>Then I got shown to the doctor’s office; she examined me thoroughly and then gave me some mucus-clearing meds–4 different medications! Got to use a little bit of German, but her English was good.</p>
<p>Went back to Culmann, made myself an omelet. Played a little frisbee with Abhi. Then</p>
<h2 id="film-club">Film Club</h2>
<p>Walked over to the CS building, which is also where the student association and therefore the film showing was. Got some hot tea and red bean cakes (Asian-themed) and sat down. The movie was incredibly bizarre. It was called Fallen Angels and set in Hong Kong, and followed 2 seemingly parallel plotlines. The subtitles were in German, but I don’t think anyone sitting around me understood the movie either. What a bizarre experience! At least the movie had good music (swingy jazz, for some reason.)</p>
