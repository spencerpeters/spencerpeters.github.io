<p>Woke up blearily, quickly packed for today’s trip, showered, made myself some tasty oatmeal, and headed to class with Daniel.</p>
<p>The class started abruptly with an exam. Everyone thought it would be after at least the first break. No biggie! Squashed the darn thing and took a walk. Explored a random building:</p>

</figure>
<p>Went to the language center after our break and played a goofy game, the “put a card to your forehead and try to find out what you are” game. I played with Do Yoon and two dudes from Taiwan and it was actually really fun.</p>
<p>At lunch break I had some venison, nom:</p>

</figure>
<p>After lunch we got our exams back and our language certificates. I stayed in the classroom a bit longer to solve a Haskell problem and thank the teachers, then puttered back to Culmann. Left a bit later, armed with beer and cheese and bread, to meet Daniel and Cody at the HB. Missed the first train because it took me a little while to book the ticket. The train was a bit late in departing and I was booking on my phone, so actually I could have got the ticket a minute after departure and still boarded, but apparently that is not allowed :P The app warned me that I couldn’t book a ticket after the train had departed. So we wandered around for a bit, and Daniel got an expensive coffe and donut. No problem in the end, though; the tickets are flexible so we boarded the next train:</p>

<h2 id="bern">Bern!</h2>
<p>And off thence to Bern, the “capital” of Switzerland! The government building there was really cool:</p>

<img src="../images/gbuild3.jpg" alt="gbuild3" /><br />
<img src="../images/gstonework.jpg" alt="gstonework" /></p>
<p>We even had a view of the Alps:</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The rest of Bern was astonishingly pretty as well.</p>
<p><img src="../images/spire.jpg" alt="spire" /><br />
<img src="../images/spire2.jpg" alt="spire2" /><br />
<img src="../images/spire3.jpg" alt="spire3" /></p>
<p>We saw the clock tower where Einstein apparently had a special relativistic epiphany:</p>

</figure>
<p>Then walked down to the riverbank, which was really lovely and reminded me of home. We chatted about networks and admired the rushing water:</p>

<img src="../images/sunny_cathedral.jpg" alt="sunny_cathedral" /><br />
<img src="../images/sunny_river.jpg" alt="sunny_river" /></p>
<p>Back up the riverbank through some weird stairs:</p>
<p><img src="../images/gstairs.jpg" alt="gstairs" /><br />
<img src="../images/entering_stairs.jpg" alt="entering_stairs" /></p>
<p>And onto a platform overlooking the river:</p>

<img src="../images/rowhouse3.jpg" alt="rowhouse3" /><br />
<img src="../images/hillset.jpg" alt="hillset" /><br />
<img src="../images/riverset.jpg" alt="riverset" /></p>
<p>Then we went to the cathedral whose spire dominated the landscape. This cool artwork was all that survived the Protestant de-idolatrization:</p>

<p>Walked back into town:</p>

<img src="../images/child_eating_dude.jpg" alt="child_eating_dude" /></p>
<p>Ate tasty rosti.</p>
<p><img src="../images/rosti.jpg" alt="rosti" /><br />
<img src="../images/rosti2.jpg" alt="rosti2" /></p>
<p>Then we had a slice of apricot pie, which was really tart. The proprietor brought us some extra desserts for free. They were strange and looked like sweet doughy spaghetti, probably a cream extruded from something.</p>
<p>Finally, back to Zürich! Book a ticket nicely in advance, to avoid the debacle of our departure. Read <em>Cryptonomicon</em> on the way back. Up the hill to Culmann… snap! I realize I bought a ticket when I could have used my hot-off-the-presses free-after-7 card, and start kicking myself in the head. Fortunately this phase doesn’t last too long, and drowns in exhaustion. I register my SwissPass card which just arrived, write this log, make Deo (actually spelled Teo, as in Teodora) a camomile because she looks pretty beat too. We chat for a bit and then I hit the hay.</p>
